The application's primary aim was to promote energy sustainability and encourage positive behavioural traits in individuals to combat climate change. The application served as a comprehensive platform for all climate change-related topics, offering an array of features, including an updated live RSS newsfeed, visual displays of the direct environmental impact, a checklist for monitoring recent activities, daily tips, interactive games, an achievement system, a social community page, and more. The development of this application took place in Android Studio, predominantly utilising Java and XML. Java was instrumental in creating an SQLite database to securely manage user login credentials and provide a unique and personalized user experience. The project was efficiently micro-managed, employing the Agile methodology, and stands as a testament to my diligence. While the project's strengths were evident, certain limitations were acknowledged. These included the exclusion of in-depth behavior monitoring through observational ethnographic methods and the collection of data through diary logs. As a result, the project primarily addressed the research question, \"Can a mobile application encourage positive behavioural traits for combatting climate change?\" from a theoretical perspective due to the application's custom-tailored nature. The project received a commendable grade of 65%, and there are aspirations to potentially transition the application to the Google Play Store in the future. If interested, I can provide a copy of the thesis or a live demonstration of the application upon request.`,\r\n            category: \"Coventry University Project (Dissertation)\",\r\n            period: \"December 2016 - April 2017\",\r\n            grade: \"2:1\",\r\n            youtubeVideo: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP2W6iHUZ7s&ab_channel=KieranE\",\r\n            tags: [\"Java\", \"Android Studio\", \"Agile Methodology\", \"Mobile Application Development\", \"Git\", \"Gantt Chart\"],\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            title: \"Agile Development: Agile Assassins\",\r\n            university: \"Coventry University\",\r\n            period: \"May 2017\",\r\n            category: \"Coventry University Project (Group)\",\r\n            description: (\r\n                <span>\r\n                    As I approached the conclusion of my university journey, I participated in a comprehensive group project within the Agile Development module.
