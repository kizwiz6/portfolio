These require developers with a complex range of skills and the ability to work to clearly defined web standards. This module helped lay the foundations of these skills and gave me the knowledge required to develop interactive, dynamic websites that perform useful functions. For the assignment, we were tasked with creating our own, unique dynamic website using Cloud 9 as the IDE. For my own website, I wanted to create a fitness guide to make use of the different JavaScript functionalities in order to incorporate multimedia interactivity, so that the website will not only be informative but also offer a unique experience for the user. Furthermore, I wanted to design the website for a pervasive interface. This meant creating a simple but controlled design that would have the suitable ergonomics for multiple displays. Other desired features included easy drop-down menu display, navigational buttons, interactive visual infographics, a database showcasing inspirational fitness 'legends', and finally feature an active comment form for the visitors to express their opinions on the website. The module then culminated with a reflective report.",category:"Coventry University Project",period:"May 2016",grade:"2:1",tags:["HTML","CSS","JavaScript","SQL","Python","Flask"],youtubeVideo:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dXH2bPHuy0"},{title:"Real World Project: T3 (Team 3 - Group Project)",period:"May 2016",category:"Coventry University Project (Group)",description:(0,m.jsxs)("span",{children:["During my second year at university, I engaged in a module that simulated real-world project collaboration with IBM. Our objective was to develop a conference room booking website that seamlessly integrated a wayfinder application and a virtual reality system to showcase room layouts. This project required us to deliver live presentations, compile a comprehensive group report, and contribute individually to our shared goals. As the project leader for Team 3 (T3), I took the lead on developing the wayfinder application while also assisting in the creation of the website. Additionally, I authored our group report, ensuring that our collective efforts were coherent and well-articulated. I embraced the challenge of designing the wayfinder application using PopApp (now known as 'Marvel'), resulting in a high-fidelity paper prototype. Given that my application development skills were still evolving, this mock-up approach was particularly suitable for our needs. I worked closely with our design team to ensure that the visual elements complemented the application's functionality, thereby fostering effective communication and collaboration throughout the project. The completed wayfinder application included accessible hyperlinks and a QR code, significantly enhancing the visitor experience by providing intuitive navigation of the conference room layout.
